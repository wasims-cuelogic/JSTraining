  <ul>
  	<li>Accept two string values as arguments, where first value will be a long word(can be any random characters as well), second string will be a single character or substring that will already exist in the first value.</li>
  	<li>The function should then return an object with properties - 'count' which will count the no of occurrences of substring in the first value, ' lastIndex' which will return the index of last occurrence of the substring in the first value.  return -1 if the substring can't be found</li>
  </ul>
