/*
Write a program that will print number from 1 to 100 using all the variants of a loop structure(for,while,do while etc)

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
